# A2-P1-Landscape
A landscaping company needs a program that computes the price of landscaping for a new housing development. Work orders are based on: address, plot length and width in feet, type of grass (“fescue”, “bentgrass” or “campus”), and number of trees. The price is computed as follows:  
•	There is a base labour charge of $1000. 
•	If the surface (length * width) is over 5000 square feet, add $500. 
•	The cost is calculated per square foot. If the grass is “fescue” the cost is $0.05; for “bentgrass” it is $0.02; “campus” is $0.01. 
•	Each tree requested has a $100 charge.
